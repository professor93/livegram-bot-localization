      To connect a bot, you should follow these two steps:

      1. Open @BotFather and <a href="http://telegra.ph/Create-Bot-Livegram-FAQ-03-29">create a new bot</a>.
      2. You'll get a token (e.g. 12345:6789ABCDEF) — just forward or copy-paste it to this chat.

      <b>Warning!</b> Don't connect bots already used by other services like Chatfuel, Manybot, ect.

      <b>How do I reply to incoming messages?</b>
      Use Telegram's <a href="https://telegram.org/tour/groups#replies">reply</a> feature. Swipe left (or double-click) on the message you want to reply.

      <b>How can I allow other users to reply through my bot?</b>
      Create a group and add your bot there so that all chat members can reply to incoming messages.

      <b>How can I edit a welcome message?</b>
      To edit a welcome message or add other languages to the bot, choose 'Open Bot Settings' and go to 'Localizations'.
